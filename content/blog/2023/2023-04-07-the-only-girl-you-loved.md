He was shy since childhood, and didn’t know how to interact with a girl !! He was a late bloomer. Although he had many crushes they were just crushes! All was going pretty well until he met this girl !! She was kind, she was pretty! you know you do good for people and always get used, he was that kind of guy, but still, he didn’t abandon kindness. It was the first time ever someone was kind to him !! You meet very few people in your life with whom your vibes match. You can talk with them about any topic for hours that was the bond they shared.

He was introvert and she extrovert. He used to get upset about little things and she used to cheer him up, She used to say “Chill mar yaar, jiwan kiti sundar ahe !!” but never told him “It's only beautiful when you meet the right people”.

He got addicted to her, she was like a drug. He started loving the world again, He found joy in every little thing. What do you call this feeling, Is it love? some people might call it hormones because they don't believe in love. At first, he also didn't believe in love. Love is a very mysterious disease, its symptoms are - You remember every small details they told you, you like every small habit of that person like speaking a word twice, "yes yes, thank you thank you" !!! Love is really a mystery, And one day he did it, he could no longer hold it inside, He confessed his feelings. She was the first and I guess the last girl he confessed.

I don't know if it was her previous heartbreak, or he was just not good enough for her, but she kindly rejected him, I guess she also liked her bond with him, she asked him to be Yuji for her Nobara ! and that's where it all went wrong ! he never faced rejection in his life I mean it was his first ever confession ! he battled his monsters every day and still tried so hard to be her friend but little did he knew it would mess him up !! ["Fairytale"](https://open.spotify.com/album/6EWWmTEOXI58PL13vNk67S) was his anthem. Someone rightly said, “Don't try to be friends with a girl you love, and never if you have already confessed”. but no one told him that. He learned it from life. He thought, what could go wrong, even if she said No, they could still be friends. but that's where he was wrong. He watched that bond crumbling right before his eyes, it haunted him every night !! all the dreams he had shattered before his eyes.

Everyone goes through heartbreak, it's nothing new ! Sometimes things don't work out !! but it was different for him. Psychologist says there is this number which is high for some people and they feel every emotion stronger than other people, they call this number EQ. Not everything in life goes like you wished it would go! I guess that's life. He tried to be a good friend. The girl who used to share every detail with him grew apart, she liked traveling a lot and used to share itineraries (a new word he learned, just like ‘auladi’) with him. On asking for captions for her travel photos to other boys, he used to feel jealous. He knew she found new people and there is nothing he could do. I mean he was just a friend to her (was he ?), so what right he had to feel jealous?

He thought it's just a chapter in his life and everything would be normal, but once a broken always a broken! just when he forgot her voice, and what she looked like, he decided to meet her !!! Really love is the most twisted curse of them all. The person who can make you the happiest holds the power to make you miserable! They talked about a lot of stuff, how he missed those old days !! He wished time would stop, this moment shall never pass !! but it's time, it keeps flowing. he got to know she is marrying someone!!  fate is really cruel sometimes. They say “Kisi chij ko puri shiddat se chalo, to puri kainat use…”. but no one tells that, “ki agar wo chij na mile to jindagi narak ban jati hai” so never love someone more than yourself. The person he wanted to have for a lifetime, someone got her for free, without suffering for her…. life is really cruel.

I guess it's not just life, maybe he was wrong this time. He always thought he had good eyes for people but he was wrong for the first time! he thought she is Hinata for his Naruto !!! but little did he know that Hinata only exists in fiction. The reality is filled with Sakuras !!

The wheel of time has turned against him! It was like time has stopped for him and he is stuck there, perhaps he don't deserve nice things, perhaps he is paying for the sins he doesn't remember !!
