He was shy since childhood, didn't know how to interact with a girl !! He was a late bloomer. Although he had many crushes
they were just crushes ! All was going pretty good until he met this girl !! she was kind, she was pretty ! you know you do good for people and always get used !! but still you dont abandon kindness !!
it was the first time ever someone was kind to him !! you know you vibe with stranger and be it any
topic you can talk for hours that was the bond they shared. He was introvert and she extrovert. He used to get upset about little things and she used to cheer him up, She used to say
"chill mar yaar, jiwan sundar ahe !!" but never told him "jivan sundar ahe, when you meet the right people" He was what you call bookworm. What is love ?
The definition of love changed forever for him until he met that one person !

Although they never met in real life, online attachment is very real thing !! he was not used to this,
They used to talk about anything, its like he got addicted. But every good thing has a end. It was like a drug. His heart used to ache if he didn't talk with her
He didnt belive in love, although he was a bookworm. You miss that person, you remember every small details they told you, you like every small habit of that person
like speaking a word twice, yes yes, thank you thank you !!! some people will call it harmones but I call it love ! although many people will criticize, how can you love
someone when you never met !! its a mistery, dont know how love works !! and he did it, he could no longer hold it inside and he confessed his feelings, I guess that is where
it all went wrong !! She was the first and I guess last girl he confessed !

I dont know if it was her previous heart break, or he was just not good enough for her, she kindly rejected him, I guess she also liked her bond with him, she asked him to be yuji for her nobara !
and thats where it all went wrong ! he never faced a rejection in his life I mean it was his first ever confession ! he battled his monsters everyday and still tried so hard to be her friends
but little did he knew it would mess him up !! "I am in love with a fairy tale, even though it hurts!" was his anthem. Dont try to be friend with a girl you love, and never if you have already confessed !!
but no one told him that, life taught him. He watched that bond crumbling, it haunted him every night !! all the dreams he dreamt he saw them shattered before his eyes

everyone has heartbreak, its noting new ! sometimes things dont work out !! but it was different for him. He felt every emotion more than others I guess people with high EQ feels
not everything goes like you wished it would go! I guess thats life. He tried to be good friend. The girl who used to share every detail with him grew apart, she liked travelling a lot and used to share iterinary (new word he learned, just like auladi)
with him. On asking for caption suggetion for her travel photos to other boys, he felt jealous. He knew she found new people and there is nothing he could do. I mean he was just a friend to her (was he ?), what right he had to feel jealous!

He thought its just a chapter in his life and everything would be normal, but once a broken always a broken ! just when he forgot how she looked like, when he forgot her voice he decided to meet her !!!
Really love is the most twisted curse of them all. The person who can make you the happiest holds the power to make you miserable !
They talked about lot of stuff, how he missed those old days !! he wished time would stop, this moment shall never pass !! but its time, it keeps flowing
he got to know she is marrying someone, fate is really cruel sometimes. They say "kisi chij ko puri shidday se chalo, to puri kainat use". but no one tells that, "ki agar wo chij na mile to jindagi narak ban sakti hai" so never love someone more than yourself
life is cruel, the person he wanted to have for lifetime, someone got her for free, without suffering for her.... I guess its life !!! life is cruel

I guess its not just life, maybe he was wrong this time. He always thought he has good eyes for people but he was wrong for the first time! he though there would be hinata for his naruto !!! but little did he know
that hinata only exists in fiction. The reality is filled with sakuras !! The wheel of time has turned against him !
it was like time has stopped for him and he is stuck there, perhaps he dont deserve nice things, perhaps he is paying for the sins he dont remember !!
